<h2>S01</h2>
<p id="s01">Before I started this course I had some knowledge of the main operations of Github. Also git implementation in java. I had no knowledge of git in the comand line nor github pages neither markdown. I have some minimal experiense in building websites. In highschool I did basic html sites without css or javascript. We built them using simple texteditors.  More recently I created a website for a business using Wix. In that I did no html or css or javascript. It was all handled for me in a visual editor. I have done some amount of javascript tutorials. These tutorials took me through javascript basics and how to connect to html and how to write html inline javascript. I coded in javascript the logic for a simple dice game in the browser. 
    Today I learned how to use git and git terminal. Also how to use Github pages to display my work. Also I learned about the history of the internet. I was also informed about the course contend and how it will proceed in the future.</p>
