<h1>My report page in the course DA377B VT20</h1>

<p><img src="img/me.jpg" width="500" alt="Me on an image"></p>

<p>My name is Martin Zannato.</p>
<p>I hate university. This is my third university. I do this only to avoid getting a job. I am a terrible person. I prefer to sit on a chair and stare blankly into the void than to sit down and study for university. I am also trying to learn swedish but not really. I just go to SFI twice a week to keep the lie alive. I hate my life. I wish humanity never developed conciousness.</p>
