<h1>A report from the course XXX</h1>

<h2>S01</h2>
<p>Before I started this course I had some knowledge of the main operations of Github. Also git implementation in java. I had no knowledge of git in the comand line nor github pages neither markdown. I have some minimal experiense in building websites. In highschool I did basic html sites without css or javascript. We built them using simple texteditors.  More recently I created a website for a business using Wix. In that I did no html or css or javascript. It was all handled for me in a visual editor. I have done some amount of javascript tutorials. These tutorials took me through javascript basics and how to connect to html and how to write html inline javascript. I coded in javascript the logic for a simple dice game in the browser. 
    Today I learned how to use git and git terminal. Also how to use Github pages to display my work. Also I learned about the history of the internet. I was also informed about the course contend and how it will proceed in the future.</p>

<p>Try to explain the platform .NET (C#, ASP.NET) to a skilled programmer, but newbie to this Microsoft technology.</p>
    <br>
<p>.Net is a software developement platform that is and has been maintained and developed by Microsoft. It can be used to develop a wide range of applications mainly oriented for Windows but not exlusively and web apps. This platfrom supports several programming languages. They are C# F# and Visual Basic. C# is an object oriented language that is very similiar to Java, JavaScript and C languages. ASP.NET extends the .NET developement platform with tools that make it specialized for web apps.</p>
    <br>
<p>Elaborate by comparing .NET technologies with the other technologies we learned during the course.</p>
    <br>
<p>The C# language we learned for .NET proved to be very complicated compared to JavaScript which had less of an initial learning curve and felt more intuitive also less strict. Since .NET is largely used in Windows environment it is maybe better than the other available languages for developing Windows realated stuff but as far as web developement goes I find that JavaScript with NodeJS and Express cover just about everything. PHP was also more pleasant to work with than .NET platform and C# language.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?</p>
    <br>
<p>I started by following the tutorials provided by you and then beginning the tasks. I decided to only use the command line and a simple editor for the scripts since you mentioned that was also an option. I prepared my developement environment for work. I aimed for grade 3 because I had to focus on the project and the degree thesis so I didn't have time to spend on this.</p>
    <br>
     <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
    <br>
<p>I learned what .NET is and ASP.NET which is useful knowledge. I learned how to work with C# and how to use the command line to start new projects and how to use ASP.NET to build web apps.</p>

<p>Reflection on results</p>
    <br>
<p>This analysis was performed in a group. The participants Were Martin Zannato and Andrei Casian.</p>
    <p>This is the <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s1PxviLsURwwJxOLEElPrND_GqIqyzvNAudw7Dh8H7c/edit?usp=sharing'>LINK</a> to the report on google docs.</p>
    <p>We decided to analyze pages that we use daily in our lives and that are also very popular and compare them to each other to see how they performed. The pages we analyzed were imgur, github and youtube. Obviously these pages are extremely popular and there are some big companies behind them so they are very well optimized all over. The results we found were not that much surprising. Github performed the best overall because unlike youtube and imgur it is not that content heavy. The latter mentioned websites load images and videos on page load so they take at some points conciderably more resources than a more text oriente github.</p>
    <p>Prposed optimizations for imgur:</p>
    <p>Avoid an excessive DOM size. This would be hard to do because the page will have to sacrifice it's endless scrolling mode and continous image loading which makes for addictive behaviour but it would increase it's speed by a significant amount.
    Another advice would be to properly size images and that would save around 0.35s.
    </p>
    <p>Proposed optimizations for github:</p>
    <p>One suggestion is to serve static assets with an efficient cache policy. This is not a very quick fix since it requires some rework but it is very important and useful in the long term. It would greately increase page reload speeds.</p>
    <p>Proposed optimizations for youtube:</p>
    <p>A very inpactful suggestion for optimization is to limit the impact of third-party code on the page. Now youtube probably dont want to do this and are very well aware of it but limiting all the metric calculating applications and ads loading would help improve speeds in a big way.</p>
    <p>One notably bad result was the sire imgur took almost 40s to fully load its main page which is a drastic difference from the other surveyed pages.</p>
    <br>
     <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
    <br>
<p>I learned about the existance of these very good tools for measuring web page performance and actually providing very good solutions on how to improve. This will be a priceless tool for our future web developement endeavours. I also learned that some big companies will sacrifice performance in order to achieve looks or some other functionality of their pages and that cannot be helped.</p>
