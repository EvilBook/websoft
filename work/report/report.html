<section>
<h2>S01</h2>
<p>Before I started this course I had some knowledge of the main operations of Github. Also git implementation in java. I had no knowledge of git in the comand line nor github pages neither markdown. I have some minimal experiense in building websites. In highschool I did basic html sites without css or javascript. We built them using simple texteditors.  More recently I created a website for a business using Wix. In that I did no html or css or javascript. It was all handled for me in a visual editor. I have done some amount of javascript tutorials. These tutorials took me through javascript basics and how to connect to html and how to write html inline javascript. I coded in javascript the logic for a simple dice game in the browser. 
    Today I learned how to use git and git terminal. Also how to use Github pages to display my work. Also I learned about the history of the internet. I was also informed about the course contend and how it will proceed in the future.</p>

<h2>S02</h2>
<p>Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?</p>
    <br>
<p>Yes I have used a very limited amount of HTML and CSS while coding web pages in secondary school and when I used to make pages and my own protfolios with wix. But all of those used a very small amount of HTML and CSS. With javascript I worked quite a lot more in the Unity3D environment for making games. It was required by my first university. But it was very different from the javascript used to program web pages.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development.</p>
    <br>
<p>The HTML is what the end user sees in their browser. This is the canvas on which we paint. The css is used to style these HTML pages. This purely has a visual effect and HTML pages can function even without CSS. CSS is like the different colors we might use on our canvas. The javascript is the brain of the operation. It is use to execute logic on our HTML pages and process information provided by users to create a limitless possibility of interactive web pages and services. The javascript is like our many painting techniques we might use to achieve a certain effect.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts.</p>

<h2>S03</h2>

    <h3>Do you have any previous experience of client side JavaScript?</h3>
    <p>Yes I have had very minimal experience with client side JavaScript. As i explained in the first assignemnt I did some personal work before this course and I followed an online course about javascript.</p>
    <h3>Can you compare and relate the JavaScript language to any other language you know?</h3>
    <p>Yes I can. It is very similiar to Java. That is why it felt familiar at the start. It is less strick than java however but I feel this freedom helps with productivity and ease of learning the language. After using a bit I feel like I like Javascript more than Java.</p>
    <h3>Describe how you worked with the coding exercise, what grade do you aim for and how did your code turn out to be?</h3>
    <p>I started the coding excersize during the lecture. I did that because I wanted to have help if I ran into any trouble. I didn't manage to finish it in time though. I also misread some of the tasks and forgot to do them. I aimed for grade 3 because my focus was on the project instead of these assignments. I had the skills necessary to do this assignment so I just wanted it to be over with as fast as possible. My code turned out to be a bit messy because of the rush but it works so it's ok.</p>
    <h3>What is your TIL for this course section?</h3>
    <p>I learned how to fetch and work with json files. I also learned how to make a dynamic page. I learned how to use XAMPP for a temporary server to test my work and be able to load files from my local directory.</p>

<h2>S04</h2>
<h3>Tell me about your previous experience on node/npm or any equal programming tools.</h3>
    <p>I have had no previous experience with node or npm. However they do remind me of Java tools we used for network programming. It is sort of similiar in a way to the way we set up connections in Java and how we ran servers there. The only thing similar to npm I've is Maven in Java. The same ease of use for importing modules and libraries.</p>
    <h3>How do you feel about working with JavaScript, Node and Express?</h3>
    <p>I feel good about working with them. They make server side way easier to create and maintain. They are great and I like them because they help me develop stuff with only one programming language. Instead of having several like php for backend and javascript for front end.</p>
    <h3>Explain how you did take on the coding assignment, did you have a plan and did it work?</h3>
    <p>First off i paid attention in class so I could absorb as much knowledge about these technologies as possible. Then my plan was to proceed and do the assignemnt for atleast grade 3. So I did and my plan worked. I achieved grade 3.</p>
    <h3>What grade did you aim for and was it a difficult level?</h3>
    <p>I aimed for grade 3 because I had to focus on the project and wanted to invest all my time in that. Since backend is not my part in the project I didn't really want to focus on it. It was more difficult than expected to set up the whole thing but after understanding it made a lot of sense.</p>
    <h3>What is your TIL for this course section?</h3>
    <p>I learned about some powerful backend technologies. I also learned how to use them to create my own REST api and server.</p>
</section>

<h2>S05</h2>
<h3>How do you feel about PHP as a programming language?</h3>
    <p>I think php is a good programming language. I found it very useful. The fact that you can import html pages as blueprint like header and footer i great. That way you can code much less and have a faster workflow. The syntax takes a bit getting used ofcourse but it's not too difficult. Also the popularity of the language makes it a very useful ting to know when developing for the web.</p>
    <h3>Can you compare PHP to other languages you know?</h3>
    <p>I cannot recall any language that I know that is similiar to php. It only reminds me a bit of Java. It being the only language we've studied. Apart from that I cannot thing of anything.</p>
    <h3>Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?</h3>
    <p>I aimed for grade 3 because I had to focus my energy on our project. Especially since I have to focus on client side and my team chose Nodejs and epress as our server side. I am happy with the result since I achieved what I wanted. I took on the excercise by following your instructions during the lecture. They were all I needed to complete it.</p>
    <h3>What is your TIL for this course section?</h3>
    <p>I learned php. I learned how it is used and what it is used for. I learned some helpful tricks for php and how to connect it to a database. I learned how popular it was as well.</p>

<h2>S06</h2>
<h3>What is your own opinion on popularity of programming languages and what are your thoughts of future popularity among programming languages?</h3>
    <p>My own opinion on the popularity of programming languages is that there are a lot of set standards. There are well defined languages that have been around for long and like in all other industries change is slow and painful and many fight against it. So currently I feel like there are some popular languages that are popular because they are old and well known. For the future I believe these languages will still be in the top and relevant but I feel like languages like python will make their way as they are right now to the top.</p>
    <h3>What will be your own choice for selecting future programming languages?</h3>
    <p>For me I would choose python and javascript as my future languages. That is because learning javascript has shown me how useful it is for web developement. I want python because of its rapidly rising popularity and demand. Also because of it's vast library access for many diferent taksks like machine lreaning and neural networks.</p>
    <h3> Do your own investigation on https://trends.google.com (Links to an external site.) to customize your own comparison on programming languages (or frameworks) and elaborate on the results. </h3>
    <p>Comparing all the languages of interst to me namely Java, JavaScript, Python and C++ i can tell that they all have the same popularity curve. They are all falling and rising at the same time. Which is dissapointing because I expected Python to be going uphill and not downhill like the others. What didn't surprise me is that the popularity of python is way above all the other languages. This just goes to show that Java is not the most popular language like they lied to us in university. It might be the most used because literally everything can run on Java like your microwave. But this doesnt depict the job environent and opportunities. I wish university would look at this graph and introduce python into this course and stop pretending like teaching only java is the solution to all our problems.</p>
    <h3>If you were to recommend a language/framework/technology to your potential employer and your next large project, what would it be and how would you “sell it”?</h3>
    <p>Clearly it is important to know what the project is because some languages have many advantages if they are used for specific tasks. In general I would say use Java because thats the only thing we've been thaught. But I believe javascript is a good second contender. I say this because I feel like you can do pretty much anything in javascript and it being the main language of the web it is probably going to be what we use and should use anyways. So Java and Javascript it is. I'd say python too because I like it.</p>
    <h3>What is your TIL for this course section?</h3>
    <p>I learned a lot about javascript and php frameworks. I learned who maintains some of the most popular frameworks for the javascript language. I also learned that there are an excessive amount of these frameworks for as ingle person to master. They need to cut them down to a normal number that a human can actually grasp.</p>

<h2>S07</h2>
<p>Try to explain the platform .NET (C#, ASP.NET) to a skilled programmer, but newbie to this Microsoft technology.</p>
    <br>
<p>.Net is a software developement platform that is and has been maintained and developed by Microsoft. It can be used to develop a wide range of applications mainly oriented for Windows but not exlusively and web apps. This platfrom supports several programming languages. They are C# F# and Visual Basic. C# is an object oriented language that is very similiar to Java, JavaScript and C languages. ASP.NET extends the .NET developement platform with tools that make it specialized for web apps.</p>
    <br>
<p>Elaborate by comparing .NET technologies with the other technologies we learned during the course.</p>
    <br>
<p>The C# language we learned for .NET proved to be very complicated compared to JavaScript which had less of an initial learning curve and felt more intuitive also less strict. Since .NET is largely used in Windows environment it is maybe better than the other available languages for developing Windows realated stuff but as far as web developement goes I find that JavaScript with NodeJS and Express cover just about everything. PHP was also more pleasant to work with than .NET platform and C# language.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?</p>
    <br>
<p>I started by following the tutorials provided by you and then beginning the tasks. I decided to only use the command line and a simple editor for the scripts since you mentioned that was also an option. I prepared my developement environment for work. I aimed for grade 3 because I had to focus on the project and the degree thesis so I didn't have time to spend on this.</p>
    <br>
     <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
    <br>
<p>I learned what .NET is and ASP.NET which is useful knowledge. I learned how to work with C# and how to use the command line to start new projects and how to use ASP.NET to build web apps.</p>

<p>Reflection on results</p>
    <br>
<p>This analysis was performed in a group. The participants Were Martin Zannato and Andrei Casian.</p>
    <p>This is the <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s1PxviLsURwwJxOLEElPrND_GqIqyzvNAudw7Dh8H7c/edit?usp=sharing'>LINK</a> to the report on google docs.</p>
    <p>We decided to analyze pages that we use daily in our lives and that are also very popular and compare them to each other to see how they performed. The pages we analyzed were imgur, github and youtube. Obviously these pages are extremely popular and there are some big companies behind them so they are very well optimized all over. The results we found were not that much surprising. Github performed the best overall because unlike youtube and imgur it is not that content heavy. The latter mentioned websites load images and videos on page load so they take at some points conciderably more resources than a more text oriente github.</p>
    <p>Prposed optimizations for imgur:</p>
    <p>Avoid an excessive DOM size. This would be hard to do because the page will have to sacrifice it's endless scrolling mode and continous image loading which makes for addictive behaviour but it would increase it's speed by a significant amount.
    Another advice would be to properly size images and that would save around 0.35s.
    </p>
    <p>Proposed optimizations for github:</p>
    <p>One suggestion is to serve static assets with an efficient cache policy. This is not a very quick fix since it requires some rework but it is very important and useful in the long term. It would greately increase page reload speeds.</p>
    <p>Proposed optimizations for youtube:</p>
    <p>A very inpactful suggestion for optimization is to limit the impact of third-party code on the page. Now youtube probably dont want to do this and are very well aware of it but limiting all the metric calculating applications and ads loading would help improve speeds in a big way.</p>
    <p>One notably bad result was the sire imgur took almost 40s to fully load its main page which is a drastic difference from the other surveyed pages.</p>
    <br>
     <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
    <br>
<p>I learned about the existance of these very good tools for measuring web page performance and actually providing very good solutions on how to improve. This will be a priceless tool for our future web developement endeavours. I also learned that some big companies will sacrifice performance in order to achieve looks or some other functionality of their pages and that cannot be helped.</p>

<h2>S09</h2>
<p>Elaborate on a few (3-5) different security issues or concerns, from your own experience, related to web application security and relate them to the OWASP.</p>
    <br>
<p>Since we started developing a website for an actual company we ran into many security questions that we constantly as ourselves and actual concerns about the possibility of attacks and the consequences of those. Moreover to add to our fears our employer's original webpage got hacked since it used an insecure HTTP connection exposing it to a plethora of security breaches.</p>
    <p>Our first and main concern is with handling users' credit card information since our website is going to be an online store. Users will be able to save their cards for future use and also input that information when they checkout. This concern is directly related to OWASP concern of Sensitive Data Exposure. We have not yet reached a consensus on the best way to deal with this problem. This information will be stored in our database and also transmitted from client side to server side making it very vulnerable to man in the middle attacks.</p>
    
    <p>Another concern that is also somewhat related to our first concern is the fact that we are going to register users and keep their information in our database and also we will have the entire store's information in our database such as products and quantities and shipping information. This concern relates to OWASP with the Injection concern. Mainly we are thinking about our SQL database vulnerabilities and query parsing. We know that a poor design and not sufficient query checking will leave our database vulnerable to injection. And if someone manges to inject in our database then they can pretty much do anything on or with the page.</p>
    
    <p>The last main concern that plagues our daily lives is also related to OWASP and it is the broken authentication. This is again connected to the above listed concerns. In the end all the security concerns are in a way linked to each other. This authentication concern scares us in the way that if our mechanism isn't proper the same fate could befall our page as it did it's predecessor. Complete shutdown and takeover of the entire system.</p>
    <br>
<p>Summarize by providing your own guidelines to a new web programmer on the topic “The essential guidelines to follow to create secure web applications”.</p>
    <br>
<p>I would advise a new programmer to delve into security for sure. And I would tell him how to make appropriate threat assessment analysis on his work to know just how much of a risk security is and how much time should be invested.
    I would also tell them to always check all user input of any kind to their software. A small gap is enough for attackers to find ways to create all sorts of problems such as buffer overflow attacks or SQL injections.
    I will also tell them to always provide processes and users with the minimum access they need to perform their task. Never give a process or user more power than they need. Don't be lazy.
    I would also suggest to this programmer to always encrypt sensitive data when or if transmiting it through insecure channels.</p>
    <br>
     <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
    <br>
<p>I learned about how to deal with broken authentication. Most of the security concerns I knew from our course on network security. I learned from our project that it is actually not so easy to protect a system from attackers. I also learned security is expensive. On a side note I used the word 'WE' a lot in this assignemnt and it is because it concerned the work im doing on the project with my team.</p>
